## Project Overview

This project is focused on making a controller that works off the movement of a person's hand. Eventually, we will use this device to be able to control a drone. 

## Educational Value Added

PCB Design, Controls, Embedded Systems, CAD Designing, Communications

## Tasks

Design and Test Parts that will lay on top of the fingers, Test hall effect sensors, Build breadboard version of the project

## Design Decisions

Wanting a compact way to sense the position of the fingers, without having to do a calibration upon starting the device.
